## 11/27
Today I added my progress and everything else I did into the nighthawk pages template with everything in dark mode and also added in the OOP mario game version into my code. 

## 11/17
Today I created a digital clock with the help of a youtube tutorial and learned some cool functions built into javascript which use today's date and today's time! I used the date.getDay(), date.getHours(), and date.getMinutes(); to get the exact current date, hour, and minute.

## 11/16
Today I created a digital carosuel with fun baby pictures I found online.

## 11/8
Added answer prompt, with help of input. Combined random problem generator with input pass the message miniproject.

## 11/7
Added random problems, so far have 5. Plan to include answer prompt + right/wrong in the end. Included answer, prompt, extra button and source.

# 11/6
Today I had a great idea for a project! I built it off of a random quote generator, but my plan is to make a random problem generator that can then prompt you for an answer to tell you if you are right or wrong and maybe give you a solution. I am very excited for this project!

## 11/2
Today was night at the museum and it was really cool to see all the work from other students' projects. I looked at some peoples' projects but was especially inspired by Vivian's group's project, which was an emotion detector which could track points on your face and figure out if you were happy or sad. N@TM was very inspiring and makes me look forward to creating more advanced projects in the future.

My three peer reviews:

## 10/26
I messed around with the code in JM's AlienWorld. I got the top chicken to change into a bunny, but for some reason couldn't get the dancing coyotes to become princesses.

## 10/25
Today, I made a rock-paper-scissors game by suing querySelector, mathrandom, and basic logic functions : ?.

## 10/24
Today, I made a tic-tac-toe game from a youtube video and committted it to my repository. I used classes, eventListener, query searcher, and index searching to do this. I also printed commands in the console when an action was performed.

## 10/23
Today, I worked on trying to code a simple Javascript game using a Youtube video, but for some reason it wasn't working

## Everywhere In-between
- Created sprites + sprite animation (enemy sprites, link sprite)
- Experimented with platform and collision mechanism
- Experimented with moving background and controlling sprite with it

## *Week 4:*
- In our group of 4, we split up the work. One group was assigned to the calculator, and the other group was assigned to the grade calculator. Eventually we all worked on the calculator and grade calculator.
- I implemented the calculator and grade calculator
- With the help of ChatGPT I added the "/" function. On my own, I added the "âˆš" function.

## *Week 3:* 
- I pulled different projects with code from ChatGPT. I pulled the Calculator game and Game of Life game.
- I implemented WASD keys in my snake game with the help of ChatGPT.
- I got my jupyter notebook to work! I still have to figure out how to use it and run it but I took notes, so hopefully those will help
- I added an adjustable table

## *Week 2:* 
- I cloned the repository again to amend my botched files. I figured out how to create the Submenu, linking it to tabs Course, About, and Table. I created a plan.
- I personalized the website by creating Course, About, Resume and Table .md files; I added my progress to the Blogs page. I also attempted to edit the table but it wouldn't let me for some reason. Reviewed [Build a Student Page](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c4.3/c5.0/2023/08/17/markdown-html_fragments.html 'Build a Student Page'). 
- I edited the "view on Github" button to link to my own github and unlinked all of the files to add my progress log. I  committed my work to Github.
- I figured out how to add an apple as the food in the Snake game.
