    "# Introduction\n",
    "Parallax scrolling occurs when there are different layers of backgrounds that move at different speeds in relation to the character to create a sense of depth. In other words, one thing is stationary while a background moves. Parallax scrolling can be beneficial by adding interest to an otherwise static website/game. Transitions from screen to screen and other transitions that happen when the user does something like press buttons, can also help the game feel smoother.\n",
